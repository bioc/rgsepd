Description: R/GSEPD is a bioinformatics package for R to help
        disambiguate transcriptome samples (a matrix of RNA-Seq counts
        at RefSeq IDs) by automating differential expression (with
        DESeq2), then gene set enrichment (with GOSeq), and finally a
        N-dimensional projection to quantify in which ways each sample
        is like either treatment group. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0), DESeq2, goseq (>= 1.17)
Imports: gplots, biomaRt, org.Hs.eg.db, GO.db, SummarizedExperiment, hash,
