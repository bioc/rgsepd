ABSTRACT = {We present GOseq, an application for performing Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on RNA-seq data. GO analysis is widely used to reduce complexity and highlight biological processes in genome-wide expression studies, but standard methods give biased results on RNA-seq data due to over-detection of differential expression for long and highly expressed transcripts. Application of GOseq to a prostate cancer data set shows that GOseq dramatically changes the results, highlighting categories more consistent with the known biology.},

\section{Introduction}
\verb,GSEPD, is a package for streamlining RNA-Seq data analysis, targeting complex samples with low replicate count such as human tissues, where all factors (metabolic, genetic, etc) cannot be controlled statistically. As a prerequisite, you need only your multiple samples' count data as a matrix whose columns are samples and rows are RefSeq NM and NR transcript identifiers. A second matrix associates sample identifiers with treatment/condition.  Given both datasets, GSEPD will automate differential expression via DESeq2 \cite{DESeq}, functional analysis via GOSeq \cite{GOSeq}, generate heatmaps of gene expression for significantly differentially expressed genes, and subsets of genes defined by the significantly enriched GO Terms.

After gene sets are detected from a differential expression analysis, the results are merged into a novel `projection display' wherein each sample is scored according to each condition's multidimensional average expression. When the treatment samples are found to have a perturbed expression profile for a particular GO Term (geneset), all samples are scored on an axis ranging from control to treatment condition, and outliers or anomalous samples are readily apparent. Clustering quality of samples in a given geneset-space is quantified by the cluster's ``Validity score'' \cite{Validity} and an empirical permutation derived p-value. GO Terms with more genes than samples in your comparison will randomly appear enriched, so the Segregation P-value is used to determine if a GO Term is significantly segregating your samples. 

\section{Usage}
You'll need a prepared matrix of read-counts per transcript (Table \ref{MyT1}.) You can use HTSeq or RSEM or coverageBed, or any other generation method, so long as it ends with a table of counts by transcript ID. This software comes pre-packaged with a dataset based on the IlluminaBodyMap project, counted with coverageBed. The second prerequisite is a metadata table associating sample identifiers with their test-condition and a nickname to annotate figures with (see Table \ref{MyT2} for the included sample). Alternatively, the manual/Vignette for DESeq2 describes how to generate a dataset object from HTSeq read counts, you can also initialize GSEPD with the DESeqDataSet object instead of the counts matrix.

\subsection{Naming Conventions}
In \verb,R,, column names are not allowed to have spaces or certain special characters like $+$ or \/. As your sample names are the columns of the count table, this implies your sample names may not have special characters or spaces. When you load a table with invalid column headers, \verb,R, may silently convert invalid characters into periods, thus ``Sample 1'' becomes ``Sample.1''. If your metadata table (where samples must be annotated) matches the original count table, it won't match this converted name, and you'll either get an error about samples not being found, or worse, an apparently successful run with invalid data. In later stages of the \verb,GSEPD, process your test conditions also become column headers, and spaces will cause an error before completion. It's better to compare groups \verb,`test', vs \verb,`control', than \verb,`lung tissue', vs \verb,`healthy(-ish) person',.

<<dataload>>=
library(rgsepd)
data("IlluminaBodymap" , package="rgsepd")
data("IlluminaBodymapMeta" , package="rgsepd")
@

<<MyT1CodeBlock, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'>>=
T1 <- head(IlluminaBodymap,n=15L)[,c(1,2,3,4,5,9,13)]
T2 <- head(IlluminaBodymapMeta)
@

<<MyLaTeXT1Caption, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'>>=

print.xtable(xT, scalebox=0.60)

@

Next we'll sub-select $1,000$ genes from this set for speed.  Initialize the GSEPD object with the \tt GSEPD\_INIT \rm function. Finally, to indicate which conditions will be tested as this dataset includes samples from `condition' A, B, and C, we use \tt GSEPD\_ChangeConditions\rm.


<<setup>>=
set.seed(1000) #fixed randomness
isoform_ids <- Name_to_RefSeq(c("GAPDH","HIF1A","EGFR","MYH7","CD33","BRCA2"))
rows_of_interest <- unique( c( isoform_ids ,
                    sample(rownames(IlluminaBodymap),
                    size=1000,replace=FALSE)))
G <- GSEPD_INIT(Output_Folder="OUT",
          finalCounts=round(IlluminaBodymap[rows_of_interest , ]),
          sampleMeta=IlluminaBodymapMeta,
            COLORS=c(blue="#4DA3FF",black="#000000",gold="#FFFF4D"))
G <- GSEPD_ChangeConditions( G, c("A","B"))
@

This should only take a moment, and create the folder \texttt{OUT} which will hold your generated results. If you're familiar with R objects, you can explore the \texttt{G} object here and change default parameters, all set by \texttt{GSEPD\_INIT}. We'll change some parameters now to demonstrate:


<<ParameterChanging, cache=FALSE>>=
  G$MAX_Genes_for_Heatmap <- 25
  G$MAX_GOs_for_Heatmap <- 30
  G$MaxGenesInSet <- 12
  G$LIMIT$LFC <- log( 2.50 , 2 )
  G$LIMIT$HARD <- FALSE
@

Here we changed five default settings on the \texttt{G} master object. The parameters \texttt{MAX\_Genes\_for\_Heatmap} and \texttt{MAX\_GOs\_for\_Heatmap} cap how many rows you'll see on your final differential expression heatmap  (Figure \ref{fig:HM}) and the projection HMA file (Figure \ref{fig:HMA}), choosing the most significant rows so your figures are shorter. If you'd like a figure containing everything, make these values large. 

The parameter \verb,MaxGenesInSet, controls the size of evaluated GO-Terms. Default is 30, here we reduce it to 12 for speed. Calculating projection significance for large sets can be slow. Also see \verb,MinGenesInSet, for culling niche gene sets. The goal here is to limit our results to gene sets which are not too broad and not too narrow. 

The parameter \verb,LIMIT$LFC, is the $\log_2$ minimum foldchange required for significance, here we've set it to require 250\% expression up or down (default is 200\%, at LFC=1). Finally \verb,LIMIT$HARD, if \texttt{TRUE} (the default), means figures and plots will respect the specified p-value limits. Sometimes your comparison won't have any significant genes or GO-terms and later stages of the pipeline will error or quit. To force generation of all stages and plots of less-than-strictly significant sets, we have set the \verb,LIMIT$HARD=FALSE,. You'll see messages during processing if very few genes would be strictly significant, as the system adjusts the threshold automatically. By default, limits are hard at $p=0.05$. 

Now we're ready to run the pipeline:

<<GSEPD_Process, cache=FALSE>>=
  G <- GSEPD_Process( G )
@

This step can take an hour on a full genome-wide dataset. If you change something and re-run GSEPD will reuse any files it finds with the same filename, so you don't have to wait for each step again, unless the filenames change. GSEPD's automation steps will convert gene identifiers, and GOSeq can take a few minutes as it runs on three differential expression sets (the upregulated, the downregulated, and the combined). All of these results are saved as CSV files under the \texttt{OUT} folder.

We save the G object from a \tt GSEPD\_Process \rm 
routine, to retain information such as the normalized counts (wherein DESeq adjusted for library sequencing depths). This object will be passed to further visualizations, such as heatmaps and PCA.

<<GSEPD_Heatmap_-_PCA>>=
  print(isoform_ids)
  GSEPD_Heatmap(G,isoform_ids)
  GSEPD_PCA_Plot(G)
@



\section{Results}
Several files are generated from each run. When \tt GSEPD\_Process\rm 
 is invoked the pre-specified conditions are compared, or when \tt GSEPD\_ProcessAll\rm 
 is invoked, each condition is tested against all others.  For each comparison, files with the comparison listed in their filename are generated.  For a condition named ``A'' with $N$ samples, versus ``B'' with $M$ samples,  your normalized counts file will be written to \tt OUT\textbackslash DESEQ.counts.AxN.BxM.csv\rm 
for example. If one of your conditions has the letter \texttt{x} in it, please change the delimiter with something like \verb,G$C2T_Delimiter <- 'z', or other unused character.
 
\subsection{Heatmap Organizational Clustering}
Each generated heatmap figure organizes the rows and columns such that similar profiles are adjacent. For this we use the default methods of \tt gplots::heatmap.2 \rm 
which calls \tt hclust \rm
on the supplied data. For gene heatmaps where you see numbers in each cell, representing the gene's expression value calculated by \tt DESeq2::varianceStabilizingTransformation \rm
, the magnitude of a gene's expression might dominate the heirarchical clustering, so scaling is warranted. GSEPD will scale gene expression values within each row(gene) as a normal Gaussian by subtracting the row's mean and dividing out the standard deviation. Therefore it is dependent on the samples used in the figure, and heirarchical clustering with complete linkage is not guaranteed to be stable. To ensure some values of each specified color, the normalized color data is capped to a specifiable minimum and maximum (default 3) before heatmap.2's clustering is performed.
